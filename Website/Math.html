    <h2> What is math ?</h2>
    <p class="word">
        Mathematics is the science that deals with the logic of shape, quantity and arrangement. Math is all around us, in everything we do. It is the building block for everything in our daily lives, including mobile devices, architecture (ancient and modern), art, money, engineering, and even  sports.

    <h2> why Math ? </h2>

    <p class="text">
        No matter which way I look at it, math came first and foremost and was at the core of my success. Science, technology and engineering, so essential to the future success of our country, cannot thrive without practitioners having a solid mathematics foundation.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        The importance of a solid mathematics education goes much beyond the current conversation of improved proficiency on test scores. I have used the word mathematics very frequently in my education and career but never until recently thought about the actual meaning of the word.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        Once I looked from an Etymology perspective, I found interesting literal definitions in two ancient languages. In Greek, it is “learning.” In Hebrew, it’s root is “thinking.”
    </p>

    <p class="text">
        They tell us that mathematics gives us the critical ability to learn and think logically in any field of endeavor. The skills of learning today are more important than knowledge, which is so readily available on the Internet.
